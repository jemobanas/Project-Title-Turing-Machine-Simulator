Project Description:

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for simulating the behavior of a Turing machine. The simulator allows users to input a string and select from predefined Turing machine descriptions, then visually simulates the machine's execution on the input string.

Key Features:

GUI: Uses Tkinter to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the simulator.

Predefined Turing Machines: Includes four predefined Turing machines, each designed to accept specific types of strings (odd ones and even zeros, even ones and odd zeros, etc.).

String Input: Allows users to input a string for the Turing machine to process.

Simulation: Simulates the step-by-step execution of the selected Turing machine on the input string.

Result Display: Displays a message box indicating whether the input string is accepted or rejected by the Turing machine.

Potential Enhancements:

Visualize Tape and Head: Consider adding a visual representation of the Turing machine's tape and the read/write head to make the simulation more engaging and understandable.

Custom Turing Machine Input: Allow users to define their own Turing machines by specifying the states, transitions, and accepting states.

Step-by-Step Execution: Add controls for stepping through the execution one step at a time, allowing users to observe the changes in the tape and the machine's state.

Highlighting: Highlight the current state and the active cell on the tape during the simulation.

Speed Control: Allow users to adjust the simulation speed.
